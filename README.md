Differences:
As stated in our app idea document, we implemented the news feed, but would like to improve the UI of the table view in regards to how each article is displayed in each cell. We also plan to fix the issue where only about 10 articles are being retrieved. Aside from that, a lot of content is still lacking from the candidate profile views, it is taking a little bit longer than expected simply because the layout of those controllers are a bit more complicated.
