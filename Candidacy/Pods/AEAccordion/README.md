# AEAccordion
**UITableViewController with accordion effect (expand / collapse cells) & Nested XIB files (XIB inside XIB)**

> I had 2 small but interesting problems to solve and at the end I wanted to share my solution. You can see it in action below, and for details refer to the code, it's very light. Or, you can also read the [docs](http://tadija.net/projects/AEAccordion/docs/).  

**AEAccordion** is a [minion](http://tadija.net/public/minion.png) which consists of two pods:  
- [AEAccordion](https://cocoapods.org/pods/AEAccordion) - UITableViewController with accordion effect (expand / collapse cells)
- [AEXibceptionView](https://cocoapods.org/pods/AEXibceptionView) - Way to use nested XIB files (XIB inside XIB)
